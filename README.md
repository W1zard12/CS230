Client Overview
Client: The Gaming Room
Project: Web-based version of "Draw It or Lose It"
What They Wanted: A web game that can be played on different platforms.

Documentation: I did a great job keeping the documentation clear and easy to follow, 
making sure everything about the project was well-explained.

Design Document: Creating a detailed design document helped a lot. It made organizing 
the project easier and made sure I covered all the important parts before starting to code.

UX Details: I’d add more details about how different users will interact with the game. 
This would help make sure the game is easy and enjoyable for everyone.

User Needs: I talked with the client to understand what they wanted and turned those ideas 
into features for the game. It's important to focus on what the user needs to make sure the 
game is useful and meets their expectations.

Design Techniques: I used a modular approach and made sure the game is user-friendly and can
be updated easily in the future. Next time, I’d also include more feedback sessions with the 
client to make sure everything stays on track.

Focusing on what the user needs is key to designing great software. Good documentation and a 
solid design process make it easier to create something that works well and meets the client’s 
goals.
